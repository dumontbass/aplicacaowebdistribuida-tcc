<h2 id="ch13"><a id="page_133"/>Chapter 13. Polyglot Persistence</h2>
<p class="noindent">Different databases are designed to solve different problems. Using a single database engine for all of the requirements usually leads to non- performant solutions; storing transactional data, caching session information, traversing graph of customers and the products their friends bought are essentially different problems. Even in the RDBMS space, the requirements of an OLAP and OLTP system are very different—nonetheless, they are often forced into the same schema.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s think of data relationships. RDBMS solutions are good at enforcing that relationships exist. If we want to discover relationships, or have to find data from different tables that belong to the same object, then the use of RDBMS starts being difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">Database engines are designed to perform certain operations on certain data structures and data amounts very well—such as operating on sets of data or a store and retrieving keys and their values really fast, or storing rich documents or complex graphs of information.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec1">13.1. Disparate Data Storage Needs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Many enterprises tend to use the same database engine to store business transactions, session management data, and for other storage needs such as reporting, BI, data warehousing, or logging information (<a href="#ch13fig01">Figure 13.1</a>).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch13fig01"/><img alt="Image" src="graphics/13fig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 13.1. Use of RDBMS for every aspect of storage for the application</p>
<p class="indent">The session, shopping cart, or order data do not need the same properties of availability, consistency, or backup requirements. Does session management storage need the same rigorous backup/recovery strategy as the e-commerce orders data? Does the session management storage need more availability of an instance of database engine to write/read session data?</p>
<p class="indent">In 2006, Neal Ford coined the term <strong>polyglot programming</strong>, to express the idea that applications should be written in a mix of languages to take advantage <a id="page_134"/>of the fact that different languages are suitable for tackling different problems. Complex applications combine different types of problems, so picking the right language for each job may be more productive than trying to fit all aspects into a single language.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, when working on an e-commerce business problem, using a data store for the shopping cart which is highly available and can scale is important, but the same data store cannot help you find products bought by the customers’ friends—which is a totally different question. We use the term <strong>polyglot persistence</strong> to define this hybrid approach to persistence.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec2">13.2. Polyglot Data Store Usage</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take our e-commerce example and use the polyglot persistence approach to see how some of these data stores can be applied (<a href="#ch13fig02">Figure 13.2</a>). A key-value data store could be used to store the shopping cart data before the order is confirmed by the customer and also store the session data so that the RDBMS is not used for this transient data. Key-value stores make sense here since the shopping cart is usually accessed by user ID and, once confirmed and paid by the customer, can be saved in the RDBMS. Similarly, session data is keyed by the session ID.</p>

<p class="fig-caption">Figure 13.2. Use of key-value stores to offload session and shopping cart data storage</p>
<p class="indent">If we need to recommend products to customers when they place products into their shopping carts—for example, <a id="page_135"/>“your friends also bought these products” or “your friends bought these accessories for this product”—then introducing a graph data store in the mix becomes relevant (<a href="#ch13fig03">Figure 13.3</a>).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch13fig03"/><img alt="Image" src="graphics/13fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 13.3. Example implementation of polyglot persistence</p>
<p class="indent">It is not necessary for the application to use a single data store for all of its needs, since different databases are built for different purposes and not all problems can be elegantly solved by a singe database.</p>
<p class="indent">Even using specialized relational databases for different purposes, such as data warehousing appliances or analytics appliances within the same application, can be viewed as polyglot persistence.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec3"><a id="page_136"/>13.3. Service Usage over Direct Data Store Usage</h3>
<p class="noindent">As we move towards multiple data stores in the application, there may be other applications in the enterprise that could benefit from the use of our data stores or the data stored in them. Using our example, the graph data store can serve data to other applications that need to understand, for example, which products are being bought by a certain segment of the customer base.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of each application talking independently to the graph database, we can wrap the graph database into a service so that all relationships between the nodes can be saved in one place and queried by all the applications (<a href="#ch13fig04">Figure 13.4</a>). The data ownership and the APIs provided by the service are more useful than a single application talking to multiple databases.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch13fig04"/><img alt="Image" src="graphics/13fig04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 13.4. Example implementation of wrapping data stores into services</p>
<p class="indent">The philosophy of service wrapping can be taken further: You could wrap all databases into services, letting the application to only talk to a bunch of services (<a href="#ch13fig05">Figure 13.5</a>). This allows for the databases inside the services to evolve without you having to change the dependent applications.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch13fig05"/><img alt="Image" src="graphics/13fig05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 13.5. Using services instead of talking to databases</p>
<p class="indent">Many NoSQL data store products, such as Riak <a href="bib01.html#bib_61">[Riak]</a> and Neo4J <a href="bib01.html#bib_47">[Neo4J]</a>, actually provide out-of-the-box REST API’s.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec4">13.4. Expanding for Better Functionality</h3>
<p class="noindent">Often, we cannot really change the data storage for a specific usage to something different, because of the existing legacy applications and their dependency on <a id="page_137"/>existing data storage. We can, however, add functionality such as caching for better performance, or use indexing engines such as Solr <a href="bib01.html#bib_62">[Solr]</a> so that search can be more efficient (<a href="#ch13fig06">Figure 13.6</a>). When technologies like this are introduced, we have to make sure data is synchronized between the data storage for the application and the cache or indexing engine.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch13fig06"/><img alt="Image" src="graphics/13fig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="fig-caption">Figure 13.6. Using supplemental storage to enhance legacy storage</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_138"/>While doing this, we need to update the indexed data as the data in the application database changes. The process of updating the data can be real-time or batch, as long as we ensure that the application can deal with stale data in the index/search engine. The event sourcing (“<a href="ch14.html#ch14lev1sec2">Event Sourcing</a>,” p. <a href="ch14.html#page_142">142</a>) pattern can be used to update the index.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec5">13.5. Choosing the Right Technology</h3>
<p class="noindent">There is a rich choice of data storage solutions. Initially, the pendulum had shifted from speciality databases to a single RDBMS database which allows all types of data models to be stored, although with some abstraction. The trend is now shifting back to using the data storage that supports the implementation of solutions natively.</p>
<p class="indent">If we want to recommend products to customers based on what’s in their shopping carts and which other products were bought by customers who bought those products, it can be implemented in any of the data stores by persisting the data with the correct attributes to answer our questions. The trick is to use the right technology, so that when the questions change, they can still be asked with the same data store without losing existing data or changing it into new formats.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s go back to our new feature need. We can use RDBMS to solve this using a hierarchal query and modeling the tables accordingly. When we need to change the traversal, we will have to refactor the database, migrate the data, and start persisting new data. Instead, if we had used a data store that tracks relations between nodes, we could have just programmed the new relations and keep using the same data store with minimal changes.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec6">13.6. Enterprise Concerns with Polyglot Persistence</h3>
<p class="noindent">Introduction of NoSQL data storage technologies will force the enterprise DBAs to think about how to use the new storage. The enterprise is used to having uniform RDBMS environments; whatever is the database an enterprise starts using first, chances are that over the years all its applications will be built around the same database. In this new world of polyglot persistence, the DBA groups will have to become more poly-skilled—to learn how some of these NoSQL technologies work, how to monitor these systems, back them up, and take data out of and put into these systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the enterprise decides to use any NoSQL technology, issues such as licensing, support, tools, upgrades, drivers, auditing, and security come up. Many <a id="page_139"/>NoSQL technologies are open-source and have an active community of supporters; also, there are companies that provide commercial support. There is not a rich ecosystem of tools, but the tool vendors and the open-source community are catching up, releasing tools such as MongoDB Monitoring Service <a href="bib01.html#bib_45">[Monitoring]</a>, Datastax Ops Center <a href="bib01.html#bib_51">[OpsCenter]</a>, or Rekon browser for Riak <a href="bib01.html#bib_60">[Rekon]</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">One other area that enterprises are concerned about is security of the data—the ability to create users and assign privileges to see or not see data at the database level. Most of the NoSQL databases do not have very robust security features, but that’s because they are designed to operate differently. In traditional RDBMS, data was served by the database and we could get to the database using any query tools. With the NoSQL databases, there are query tools as well but the idea is for the application to own the data and serve it using services. With this approach, the responsibility for the security lies with the application. Having said that, there are NoSQL technologies that introduce security features.</p>
<p class="indent">Enterprises often have data warehouse systems, BI, and analytics systems that may need data from the polyglot data sources. Enterprises will have to ensure that the ETL tools or any other mechanism they are using to move data from source systems to the data warehouse can read data from the NoSQL data store. The ETL tool vendors are coming out with have the ability to talk to NoSQL databases; for example, Pentaho <a href="bib01.html#bib_54">[Pentaho]</a> can talk to MongoDB and Cassandra.</p>
<p class="indent">Every enterprise runs analytics of some sort. As the sheer volume of data that needs to be captured increases, enterprises are struggling to scale their RDBMS systems to write all this data to the databases. A huge number of writes and the need to scale for writes are a great use case for NoSQL databases that allow you to write large volumes of data.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec7">13.7. Deployment Complexity</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once we start down the path of using polyglot persistence in the application, <strong>deployment complexity</strong> needs careful consideration. The application now needs all databases in production at the same time. You will need to have these databases in your UAT, QA, and Dev environments. As most of the NoSQL products are open-source, there are few license cost ramifications. They also support automation of installation and configuration. For example, to install a database, all that needs to be done is download and unzip the archive, which can be automated using <code>curl</code> and <code>unzip</code> commands. These products also have sensible defaults and can be started with minimum configuration.</p>
<h3 id="ch13lev1sec8"><a id="page_140"/>13.8. Key Points</h3>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Polyglot persistence is about using different data storage technologies to handle varying data storage needs.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Polyglot persistence can apply across an enterprise or within a single application.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Encapsulating data access into services reduces the impact of data storage choices on other parts of a system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Adding more data storage technologies increases complexity in programming and operations, so the advantages of a good data storage fit need to be weighed against this complexity.</p>
